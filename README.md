To customize colors & font simply edit the first section of the CSS file and it will apply to the rest of theme without running through all the code. You may need to adjust font sizes depending on the font used and your screen resolution to make everything fit.

*Be sure to also edit the config.yaml Home widget with your own username.*

Hope you enjoy!
